 * Motives may have '|' vertical bars which stand for "bar lines."  This
 * is strictly a convenience for formatting lists of parameters.  
 * A bar line may take an optional label which is concatenated to the '|'.
 * In the example below, "label" and "xyzzy" are bar line labels.  These
 * can be used to encode "rehearsal numbers" in the score.
