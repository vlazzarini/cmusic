/*
 * You might have occasion to want to do certain actions before any Player
 * is run, or to do some action after the last Player is done.  Statements
 * in the procedure M_start() are executed after the Players are cueued,
 * but before any are run.  In this instance, we print a string which will
 * set the sample rate in cmusic.  We then modify element 9 in the global
 * array used for specifying pitches.  As a result of this assignment, any
 * reference to the pitch  a  in any octave will return a value of 435.0
 * (times the appropriate octave) instead of 440.0.
 * 
 * The procedure M_ter() is executed after the last Player and before
 * "ter;" is printed by ccmp.
 * 
 * Notice that M_start() and M_ter() are procedures, and must have
 * parenthesis after their names, whereas P_start is just a word that
 * appears at the head of a block inside a Player, and does not have
 * parenthesis after.
