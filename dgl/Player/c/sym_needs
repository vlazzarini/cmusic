Need to go from a Player (*x)() to the class list entry.
Need to go from a Player char * name to the class list entry.

Need to go from an event to an instance entry.

For notes, go from string address to a (possibly) already parsed
	finite-state atomaton.  However, if a static string is
	supplied, it will be the same address for all instances of
	that player.  In this case, we might want to key on the
	value of Self as well as the string address to disambiguate.
