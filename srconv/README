srconv keeps a stable of filterfiles in a "wired-in" directory to be
used under certain default conditions.  The file <carl/paths.h>
contains the names of these paths.  If this file is correct for
your system, the filter files will be correctly installed by
default.  Otherwise, modify the srconv.c program to
refer to the area where these files are kept.  They are now in the
subdirectory ./filts with names "*.flt".

9/1/84:  convert is the preferred program in this directory
