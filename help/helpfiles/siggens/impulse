impulse - generates an impulse signal

DESCRIPTION:
impulse is simple command for generating a digital impulse signal:

	impulse 100
    
will generate a floating 1.0 followed by 99 0.0's at its standard output.
These will appear in ASCII if the standard output is connected to a
terminal, otherwise they will be binary.  

The following example would generate the impulse response of a filter
called test.flt, designed by the fir program (cf "help fir"), and store
it on file imp.resp, which could be plotted on the VT55 terminal with
plotf:

    impulse 1000 | filter test.flt > imp.resp
