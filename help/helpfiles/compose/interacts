interacts -interactive score writing program, using /usr/new/lib/insts/*

This program interacts should take care any questions which usr might ask 
 --by typing a question mark after the instruction. 

To get list of instrument type "?" or <return> after the prompt sign. When you
desided which instrument to use just simply give names, for example, 
    Name of instruments : ins1 ins2 .. insN (can be more than one) <return>

A few hint for note statements

        Frequency :
		   Any input which can be allowed in CMUSIC or
		   A(N)  B(N) .. G(N)  etc. where N is octave ( A(0) =440Hz ).
				An(0) A natural ( same as A(0) )
				As(0) A sharp
				Ab(0) A flat
		   C0(N) C1(N) .. C19(N) are note scale in which octave are 
					 divided into 20 intervals.
	Amplitude :
		   any input which can be allowed in CMUSIC or
		   pppp ppp pp p mp mf f ff fff ffff
                   -30dB  to -3dB  with interval of 3dB. 
	Tempo setting : 
		Tempo can be set at the bigining of a note. 
		Type 't' when the program asked a attack time. 
		MM 4.=50 gives 50 dotted quarter note in one minute.
	Duration  :
		Any positive floating number. 2.5 gives 2.5 second of sound.
		If you have sellected tempo notation( by typing 't' at
		attack time), You could use 1,2,4,.. for a whole note,
		half note and etc. as well as dotted note and triplet. 
		Type "?" for more detail.

If equal sign appears in prompt, it means suggested value --anything 
followed by "?" will become the value if <return> is typed after.
If any other value is typed, it will over write the suggested value.
For example,  Parameter?2.0  will give a value 2.0 by typing <return>.

It is more than welcome for anyone to add some interesting instruments to the
directory.

Any suggestion or bug report are welcome.
