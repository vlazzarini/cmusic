help - a description of the help command

The help command prints online documentation for CARL programs.  This
documentation is collected in a special directory for help files
(/usr/local/lib/help/* at CARL).  All users with help-ful information are
invited to add help files (say `help helper' for a description of how
to do this).

help 
    Prints the main list of topics (files) and supertopics (directories).
help X
    If X is a topic file, its contents are printed.
    If X is a supertopic directory, its contents (subtopics) are printed.
help -1 
    prints 1-line summary of the main topics and supertopics.
help -1 X
    If X is a topic file, its 1-line summary is printed.
    If X is a supertopic directory, a 1-line summary of each of its
    subtopics is printed.
help -a X
    If X is a supertopic, recursively lists all subtopics under X.
help -a
    Recursive lists ALL topics and subtopics.
help -s WORD
    Search through all help files and list those which mention "WORD".

NOTE: X may be a simple topic or supertopic name, or several supertopics 
separated by slashes (/), ending with either a topic or a supertopic name.  
For example: `help cmusic', `help -1 cmusic/gens', `help cmusic/gens/gen0'.
