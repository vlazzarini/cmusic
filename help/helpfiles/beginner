beginner - orientation about CARL programs

This is the CARL help program, designed to provide information about
programs developed at the Computer Audio Research Laboratory, San Diego.
The best way to get started is to find the CARL Startup Kit and read
the Tutorial Introduction to UNIX, Introduction to Text Editing with VI,
Cmusic, and the Csound File System.  This program is best suited to
browsing around in the CARL software, and to provide
practical information on how to make programs work.  In addition to
this program, you can use the man command and the apropos command
to get more general information about most of these programs.
