sfck - how to determine how much space is left for files

To find out how much space is left in the soundfile system, use the
command 
 
 % sfck -n <csound_filesystem>

for instance

 % sfck -n /snd

which prints:
 
   maxcyl    total     used  bigused   unused bignused  alloced    freed
      384      384      125       16      259      219        0        0

The relevant figure is bignused, which is the largest contiguous block
of storage, in cylinders.  To figure out how much time that is, use the
rule of thumb: 3.1 sec. per cylinder at 48K, 9.5 sec. at 16K.
Storage requirements are doubled for stereo.

To see an allocation map of a csound disk, including used and unused
portions, read the help file for the command "sdc".
