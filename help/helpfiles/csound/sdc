sdc - map of csound disk cylinder usage

DESCRIPTION:

Usage: sdc [/dev][/user]

sdc prints a map of the csound disk cylinder usage on your
terminal screen (i.e., on its standard output).  If no argument is
given, your "home" csound disk is used, 
and your own
sound files are specially indicated.  The argument may be either a
csound device (/snd or /snd1, currently), or a user name (preceded
with a slash, according to csound program conventions), or both (concatenated
together).

Examples:

% sdc			- lists user's own files on user's default device
% sdc /snd 		- lists user's files on device /snd
% sdc /rusty		- lists rusty's files on user's default device
% sdc /snd1/dgl		- lists dgl's files on device /snd1
