showpath - generate a graph of a sound path

showpath x[bvpn] y[bvpn] filename[s] temp1[d] temp2[d] temp3[d]

Causes a "device-independent" plot of one or more sound paths to be 
generated on the named file suitable for viewing on terminals with 
graphics capability (such as a Visual 550 or a Diablo printer), or 
on a graphics printer (such as a laser graphics printer).  This is 
useful for debugging or demonstrating.  Showpath uses graph to 
generate the plot (see "man graph").  The following score illustrates 
its use:

    #include <carl/cmusic.h>
    set stereo;

    #define FILENAME s1
    #define DEFSTRING(string)var p2 string 

    DEFSTRING(FILENAME) "path.out" ;

    ins 0 one;
    {env}	seg  b4 p5 f4 d .1sec 0 .1sec;
    {pulser}	osc  b5 b4 p10 f5 d;
    {x}		osc  b2 p7 p8 f2 d;
    {y}		osc  b3 p7 p9 f3 d;
    {front}	adn  b3 b3 p11;
    {carrier} 	osc  b1 b5 p6 f1 d;
		showpath b2 b3 FILENAME d d d; {generate plot}
		SPACE(b1,1) b2 b3 0 1 0dB;
    end;
    SAWTOOTH(f1);
    SINE(f2);
    COS(f3);
    GEN1(f4) 0,0 1/3,1 2/3,1 1,0;
    PULSE(f5);
    GEN3(f6) 3/4 -1/4;

    note 0 one 2 0dB 440Hz 10 2sec 2sec 11Hz 0;

    sec;
    ter 4;

This score produces a file called "path.out" which can be viewed,
for example, on a Visual 550 terminal via the command:

    cat path.out | v550

NOTE:  If the graphics output file is named as above, then only the
       LAST plot generated will appear on it.  To place more than
       one plot on the file (e.g., for several notes), then prefix
       the filename with a single > character, such as ">path.out",
       making sure there are no blanks in the string that names
       the file.  This will cause successive paths to be appended
       to the file, corresponding to the UNIX convention "cmd >>file".
