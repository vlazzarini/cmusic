logar - logarithm of a signal

logar  output[b] in[bvpn] ;

The output of the logar generator is equal to the logarithm (to the
natural logarithmic base e = 2.71828...) of the input.  

                           output = ln( in )

If the input is not greater than 0.0, chaos is guaranteed to result.
