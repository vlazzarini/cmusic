quant - linear quantizer for signals

quant  output[b] in[bvpn] imin[bvpn] imax[bvpn] steps[bvpn] ;

The input signal is considered to lie in the range [imin, imax].
The output lies in the same range, but quantized into the specified
number of discrete steps which are linearly distributed between
imin and imax accord to the relation

                                                    (in-imin)
                                   floor[ steps * ------------- ]
                                                   (imax-imin) 
    output = imin + (imax-imin) * -----------------------------
