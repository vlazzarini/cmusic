shape - general purpose shape generator

shape output[b] table[fvpn] sum[dpv] ;

A truncating, table lookup oscillator with amplitude automatically set to
1, and frequency automatically set to p4sec.  In other words, this unit
generator simply scales the function given in table to the note duration.
Dynamic variables are recommended for sum locations. Table may be either 
explicit, or number may be given.  If number is n, then function floor(n) 
is used.  
NOTE: This unit generator is equivalent to (but faster than) an osc with
amplitude = 1.  It is not significantly faster than the freq unit generator,
but it obviates the need for a p-field set to p4sec.
