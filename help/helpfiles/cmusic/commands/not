not - the cmusic note command

note statements have the general form:

    note T INS DUR PARAMETERS ;

where:
    T          is the action (beginning) time (in seconds),
    INS        is the name of the instrument to be played,
    DUR        is the duration of the note (in seconds), and
    PARAMETERS are note parameters as required by the named instrument.

Note parameters are traditionally numbered from the beginning of the
note statement, therefore the action time is p2 and the duration is
p4.  Except for p1 and p3 (the "note" and "INS" fields), all note
parameters may be single-valued expressions made up of a variety of
operands and operators (see "help cmusic/expr").

NOTE:  If the action time is set to "p2", then the note will start at
the most recently mentioned action time.  Starting a note at time
"p2+p4" starts it immediately after the previous note is finished,
etc.
