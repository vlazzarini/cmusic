pri - the cmusic print command

This command has the general form:

    print T parameters ;

It causes the values of the parameters to be printed out on stderr at
time T.  A parameter beginning with a percent sign is interpreted as a
string and that string (without the %) is printed out literally.
Example:

    print 2.55 %time= p2 ;
