set - the cmusic set command

Cmusic command line flags have the possibility of overriding set
options specified in the score (see "help cmusic/commandline").  Only the
first three characters of any option name are significant, i.e., "set
verbose;" may be written as "set ver;".

set barefile = filename; 
    Produces a "bare" score listing on the named file.  A "bare" score
    has all macros and expressions replaced with their numerical
    values  [Default: no barefile is produced].
set blocklength = N;
    Sets the io block length to N [Default: N = 256] (in command flag
    form, use -BN).
set channels = N; set nchannels = N; set stereo; set quad;
    Determine the number of output channels  [Default: N = 1].
set cutoff = N;
    sets cutoff threshhold for computing the tail of the global reverb
    to N [Default: N = .0001 (= -120dB)].
set defer;
    causes the next note statement encountered to be executed after all
    other simultaneously-sounding note statements.  Note that only the
    next note statement is affected.  If multiple deferred notes play
    simultaneously, they are executed in the order that they are encountered
    in the notelist.
set direct = N; set reflect = N;
    sets "distance amplifier" values for direct and reflected soundpaths
    during spatial processing.  Amplitude along direct and reflected paths 
    are proportional to 1/(1+d^direct) and 1/(1+d^reflect) where d is the 
    length of the path.  direct and reflect are normally equal to 1.0.
    Setting these parameters to values greater than 1 expands distances, 
    while setting them to values less than one compresses distances.
    [Default: N = 1 in both cases].
set floatoutput;
set nofloatoutput;
    Specifies whether cmusic should produce 32-bit floating point sample
    values  [this is the default].  If floats are not produced, 16-bit
    2s complement short ints are produced.
set functionlength = N;
    Sets the default score function length to N [Default: N = 1024]
    (in command flag form, use -LN).
set header;
set noheader;
    Specifies whether a csound header should be produced by cmusic
    (such headers are normally transparent to the user).  [The default
    is to produce the header.]
set listingfile = filename;
    Produces a score listing on the named file [Default: no listing
    is produced].  If this command is given with no list filename
    specified, cmusic will create a file with the same name as the
    score file with a ".list" extension.
set noclip;
    turns off clipping of cmusic output (allows float output to exceed
    range of -1 to +1 in magnitude) [Default: clipping is turned on]
set notify;
    Specifies that cmusic should produce its termination message on the
    terminal (in command flag form, use -n; the -q flag turns off any
    notify, timer or verbose options in the score).
set outputfile = filename;
    Causes cmusic to place its sample output on the named file instead
    of stdout.
set rand = N; set seed = N;
    "Seed" the random number generator with N.
set sfbuffersize = N;
    Sets the buffersize used by the sndfile unit generator to N (CARL only)
    [Default = 16K (bytes)].
set rate = N; set samplingrate = N; set srate = N;
    Set the sampling rate to N [Default = 16K = 16384] (in command flag
    form, use -RN).
set revscale = N;
    sets relative amplitude of global reverb to N [Default = .25] (useful
    with space unit generator only).
set room = Lx1,Ly1 Lx2,Ly2 Lx3,Ly3 Lx4,Ly4;
    sets the quadrant 1, 2, 3, and 4 vertices of the inner room to
    the specified values (given in meters, with point 0,0 being the
    center of all space) [Default: 4,4 -4,4 -4,-4 4,-4]
set space = Ax1,Ay1 Ax2,Ay2 Ax3,Ay3 Ax4,Ay4;
    sets the quadrant 1, 2, 3, and 4 vertices of the outer room to
    the specified values (given in meters, with point 0,0 being the
    center of all space) [Default: 50,50 -50,50 -50,-50 50,-50]
set speakers = Sx1,Sy1 Sx2,Sy2 ... Sxn,Syn;
    sets the locations of n speakers (must be on the perimeter of the
    inner room) the specified values (given in meters, with point 0,0 
    being the center of all space) [Default: 4 speakers defined at
    4,4 -4,4 -4,-4 4,-4]
set tempowith vN;
set offsetwith vN;
    causes cmusic to use the specified variable to set the tempo or time
    offset.  If tempo is specified with, say, v1, then the values of both 
    p2 and p4 will be REPLACED with p2*v1 and p4*v1, respectively.  If 
    time offset is specified with, say, v2, then v2 will be added to all
    p2 values after they have been scaled by tempo, if any.  For example:
	#define TEMPO set tempowith v10; var p2 v10
	#define T (p2+p4)/(v10)
	TEMPO 30MM;
	note 0 one 1 440Hz 0dB;
	note T one 1 440Hz 0dB;
	note T one 1 440Hz 0dB;
    will use variable v10 to set the tempo of the score.  It is set up and 
    defined with macro TEMPO.  Note the use of v10 in the T macro.
set t60 = N;
    sets the global reverberation time to N seconds (approximately)
set timer;
    Cause cmusic to send computation timing numbers to the user's
    terminal.  When 1 second of score is completed, ":1" is printed,
    etc.  A number in square brackets following the timing value (such
    as ":5[127]") indicates the number of out-of-range samples during
    that second of output (in command flag form, use -t; the -q flag
    turns off any notify, timer or verbose options in the score).
set verbose;
    Causes cmusic to send the interpreted input listing, timing, and
    termination notification messages to the user's terminal
    (in command flag form, use -v; the -q flag turns off any notify,
    timer or verbose options in the score).
