info - general information about cmusic commands

Cmusic commands generally have the form:

    command time other ;

Only the first 3 characters in the command need be typed, although more
may be used.  For example, the commands "ter", "term", "terminate", and
"terpuffery" all mean the same thing to cmusic.

NOTE: Unit generator names in instrument definitions MUST be typed
exactly.  For example, the name of the oscillator unit generator is
"osc", and NOT "oscillator". (Unit generator names are NOT commands,
whereas "ins" is a command).

Action times are given after all commands except for "set" "merge" and
"comment".  These times specify when the command is to be executed.
Commands must be given in time order in the cmusic score unless the
"merge" command is used.

The portion of the cmusic score statement following the action time is
determined by the requirements of the individual command.
