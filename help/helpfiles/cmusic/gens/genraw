genraw - read raw floating point functions into cmusic

     genraw is an implementation of a "gen" function call for
     cmusic(1carl). The action of genraw is to read the named
     file, which must contain binary floating point numbers
     (called floatsams at CARL).  The floatsams are then written
     on its standard output. If called from inside cmusic, this
     will cause the contents of the file to be copied into a
     function in cmusic. In this way one can use e.g., results of
     the analysis of natural sounds as waveforms or envelopes in
     cmusic.

     Here is a sample call from a shell:
          % genraw -L1024 filename
     and a sample statement in a cmusic score:
          var 0 s1 "filename";
          gen 0 genraw f1 s1;

     genraw will force the number of floatsams it writes to its
     standard output to equal the number specified in len_flag by
     linearly interpolating the number of floatsams in the input
     file to stretch or shrink the file to fit.  This guarantees
     that cmusic will get as many points as it wants, but may
     have side effects of altering the character of the function
     if the stretching or shrinking are extreme.
