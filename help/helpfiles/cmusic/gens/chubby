chubby - Chebychev Polynomial function generator for cmusic

     gen 0 chubby fN DC A1 A2 A3... AN

     chubby is a gen function for cmusic(1carl). It is useful in
     generating functions for "waveshaping", or nonlinear distor-
     tion techniques.

     The arguments specify the amplitude of each of the
     partials of the Chebychev polynomial function according to:

     Tn+1(x) = 2xTn(x) - Tn-1(x)

     where Tn(0) = 0 Hz component, Tn(1) = fundamental, Tn(2) =
     first harmonic, etc.  Here is an example that produces 50%
     fundamental and 50% third harmonic:

Note:
     Whether the function returned by chubby is normalized 
     to the signed unit interval depends on the
     sum of its arguments being 1.0.  It is customary to 
     renormalize chubby functions with gen0.
