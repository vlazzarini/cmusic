cspline - smooth curve interpolater for cmusic

     gen 0 cspline fN x0 y0 x1 y1... xN yN;

     cspline is an implementation of a "gen" function call for
     cmusic(carl). It takes pairs of numbers as abcissas and ordinates
     of a function to be smoothed by a cubic spline function.  It
     produces a smoothed function that includes the input values.  It
     is similar to cmusic's gen4 smooth function generator, except that
     whereas for gen4 you must supply transition parameters to create a
     smooth function, cspline accomplishes this for you automatically.

     Here is a sample statement in a cmusic score:

     gen 0 cspline f1 0 0 .1 .1 .2 1 .3 0;

     Note: it is possible that cspline will produce y values that will
     exceed those supplied.  It is a good idea to normalize functions
     produced with cspline by running them through gen0.
