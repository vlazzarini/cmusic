sun2vax - convert sun floatsams to vax floatsams

This program is to be run on a VAX to convert data obtained from a SUN
into suitable format for the VAX.  A complete example of its usage is as
follows.  (sdcarla is the SUN, and sdcarl is the VAX in this example.)
Comments are in {}.

Copying in data files:
    sdcarl% rcp sdcarla:~dgl/waveform xxx
	{Remote copy sun floatsam file waveform to vax file xxx.}
    sdcarl% sun2vax < xxx > waveform
	{Convert it on the vax.}

Reading pipes across machines:
    sdcarl% rsh sdcarla cmusic "~dgl/file.sc" | sun2vax > waveform
	{Remote shell executes cmusic on the sun, pipes the output
	 to the vax, which reads it with sun2vax.}

Note: the "" around ~dgl/file.sc above serves to keep the ~ from
being filename expanded on sdcarl.  Unfortunately, UNIX is not
smart enough to realize we are refering to a file on sdcarla in this
context.  However, the path sdcarla:~dgl/waveform does not need to
be enclosed in "" on a technicality, namely that the pathname
does not start with ~, so it is not taken as a home directory, and
is shipped verbatim to the remote system.
