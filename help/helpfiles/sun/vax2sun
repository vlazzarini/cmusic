vax2sun - convert vax floatsams to sun floatsams

This program is to be run on a SUN to convert data obtained from a VAX
into suitable format for the SUN.  A complete example of its usage is as
follows.  (sdcarl is the VAX, and sdcarla is the SUN in this example.)
Comments are in {}.

Copying in data files:
    sdcarla% rcp sdcarl:~dgl/waveform xxx
	{Remote copy vax floatsam file waveform to sun file xxx.}
    sdcarla% vax2sun < xxx > waveform
	{Convert it on the sun.}

Reading pipes across machines:
    sdcarla% rsh sdcarl cmusic "~dgl/file.sc" | vax2sun > waveform
	{Remote shell executes cmusic on the vax, pipes the output
	 to the sun, which reads it with vax2sun.}

Note: the "" around ~dgl/file.sc above serves to keep the ~ from
being filename expanded on sdcarl.  Unfortunately, UNIX is not
smart enough to realize we are refering to a file on sdcarla in this
context.  However, the path sdcarl:~dgl/waveform does not need to
be enclosed in "" on a technicality, namely that the pathname
does not start with ~, so it is not taken as a home directory, and
is shipped verbatim to the remote system.
