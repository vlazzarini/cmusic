noteanal - simple envelope function analizer

usage: noteanal [flags] < floatsams > floatsams
 Input must be a file or pipe
 All time values are in seconds.  Use 'S' postop for sample times.
 flags:
 -wN = simple average using window size of N (128S)
 -mN = mean squared using window size of N (128S)
 -bN = set segment begin threshold to N (.01)
 -eN = set segment end threshold to N (.005); -eN must be <= -bN
 -uN = set min. segment duration (1024S)
 -lF = set log file for segmentation statistics
 -s =  turn on segmentation (b, e, l and u automatically set this)
 -uN = set min. interesting utterance size to N (1024S),
 -x =  skip output by window-size
 -z =  output the input sample rather than the average
 -v = verbose: print summary of noteanal on stderr

In the simple case, noteanal produces the mean squared energy level
corresponding to the input samples on the standard output as floatsams.
If it is connected to a terminal, it produces sample number, time (re.
48K if not changed with -R) and envelope value.
