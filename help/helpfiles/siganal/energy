energy - produce mean square energy of input

energy [flag] < floatsams > output
 flags:
 -wN	 set window size to N seconds (default: 128S)
 -sN	 skip output by window size.
 -RN	 set sample rate to N
Arguments may be expressions.  Use postop 'S' for samples.
If output is a file/pipe, floatsams are written.
If output is a terminal, sample #, time re. 48K, and value are given.

The mean square is the energy level of the input.
The -w flag puts out as many samples as are input.  The -sN flag
puts out (input samples)/N samples.
