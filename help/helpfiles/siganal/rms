rms - simple inline program to find the rms value of a digital signal

DESCRIPTION:
rms reads samples from stdin and calculates the rms (root-mean-square)
value of the digital signal.  It prints this value after all samples
have been read.  It writes samples on stdout if it is a file or a pipe. 
The following examples determine the rms value in sound file boom:

	sndin boom | rms
	sndin boom | rms | sndout boom2
