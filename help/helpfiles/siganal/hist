hist - simple inline program to calculate histogram of digital signals

DESCRIPTION:
hist reads samples from stdin and calculates a histogram of the amplitude
values contained in that signal.
It prints this histogram and various amplitude measures after all samples
have been read.  It writes samples on stdout if it is a file or pipe. 
If a file is named as an argument to hist, the histogram is placed on this
file.  The following examples determine a histogram for sound file boom:

	sndin boom | hist
	sndin boom | hist xxx | boom2 (histogram placed on file xxx)
