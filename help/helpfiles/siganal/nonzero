nonzero - indicates samples which are not equal to  0.0

usage:

    nonzero < floatsams > output

Input must be a file or pipe.  If the output is a file or pipe, the
non-zero floatsams are produced.  If the output is a terminal, a line
is produced for every nonzero sample showing sample number, sample time
(re. 48K, unless changed with -R), and sample value.  Arguments may be
expressions.
