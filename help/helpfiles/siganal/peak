peak - simple inline program to find the peak value of a digital signal

DESCRIPTION:
peak reads samples from stdin and looks for the largest in magnitude (most
negative or most positive), and prints this value after all samples
have been read.  It writes samples on stdout if it is a pipe or a file. 
The following examples determine the maximum value in sound file boom:

	sndin boom | peak
	sndin boom | peak | sndout boom2
