srconv - convert signal sampling rates by any positive rational number

DESCRIPTION:
    srconv  l m filterfile < inputdata > outputdata

The sampling rate converter is for changing the sampling rate of a 
digital signal. The output sampling rate is l/m times the input
sampling rate, where l and m are arbitrary positive integers. It
is desirable that l and m have no common factors, as this needlessly
adds to the computational complexity. Also, it is better to pipe
several stages of srconv together using small l and m rather than
use a single stage having large l and m when l and m are composite
numbers; for example, for l/m = 4/9, one can say

    srconv 2 3 % < test.dat | srconv 2 3 % > out.dat 

where % can be used to instruct srconv to use pre-designed default
lowpass filters. The default filters generally have 0.1dB passband
ripple, and -60dB stopband rejection.

The program interactively requests parameters and filenames when
arguments are missing from the command line.
