gaindelay - simple inline program to scale and delay a digital signal

DESCRIPTION:
gaindelay  reads samples from stdin, scales them by the gain factor
supplied as its first argument, delays them by the number of samples
specified by its second argument, and writes the scaled, delayed values
on stdout.  It is intended to be included in pipes with programs such
as para, chan, sndin, cmusic, impulse, etc. The following example
generates an impulse signal 54 samples long, consisting of 4 zero
values, followed by .707, followed by 49 zero values:

	impulse 50 | gaindelay -3dB 4
