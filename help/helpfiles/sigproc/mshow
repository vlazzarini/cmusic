mshow - a crude CRT display hack for comparing sample data files

mshow operates like show, but allows display of up to  
16 files or multiplexed channels to be displayed
simultaneously for comparison.  They are all presented on the same
graph, with successive files being plotted by the letters 'A', 'B', 'C',
etc.  

Note: for a more complete discussion of the various flags and options,
say
