gain - simple inline program to scale a digital signal

DESCRIPTION:
gain reads samples from stdin, scales them by the gain factor supplied
as its argument, and writes the scaled values on stdout.  It is
intended to be included in pipes with programs such as para, chan,
sndin, cmusic, impulse, etc. The following example generates an impulse
signal 50 samples long, consisting of .707, followed by 49 zero values:

	impulse 50 | gain -3dB
