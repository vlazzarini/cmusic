convolvesf - convolve stdin with soundfile 

convolve stdin with a soundfile for reverberation or special effects

DESCRIPTION

This program is identical to "convolve" except that where "convolve"
expects a filterfile, "convolvesf" expects a soundfile. (Also,
"convolve" eliminates the filter delay whereas "convolvesf"
does not, but this is very minor.)  If the soundfile contains
the impulse response of a room or of some resonator, then
the effect is to provide the input signal with precisely the
reverberation which would have resulted had the sound really
been produced in that room or resonator.

In the absence of a real room response (or even in the presence
of one), it is quite easy to synthesize extremely good sounding
artificial room responses using "cmusic".  The basic idea is just
to take exponentially decaying white noise and add a single impulse
to it at as the initial sample.  The following example score shows
how this can be accomplished:

#include <carl/cmusic.h>

#define REV_AMP 1/13
#define DURATION 1.9

set srate = 16K;

ins 0 rev;
	osc b2 REV_AMP p5 f1 d;
	ran b1 b2 8KHz d d d;
	out b1;
end;

ins 0 imp;
	osc b3 1 1Hz f2 d;
	out b3;
end;

GEN4(f1) 0,1 -10 1,0;
GEN4(f2) 0,1 0 1,1;

play 0 rev DURATION P ;
play 0 imp 1S ;
