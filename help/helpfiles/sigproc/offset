offset - simple inline program to add an offset to a digital signal

DESCRIPTION:
offset reads samples from stdin, adds a constant value supplied
as its argument, and writes the resulting values on stdout.  It is
intended to be included in pipes with programs such as para, chan,
sndin, cmusic, impulse, etc. The following example generates an 
signal 50 samples long, consisting of 2.0, followed by 49 values
equal to 1.0:

	impulse 50 | offset 1.0
