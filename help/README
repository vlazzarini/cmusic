help - program to provide orientation to beginning users

To install this program, you should edit ../../include/carl/config.m4
and modify the entry m4HELPDIR, which is the database directory
for the help program.  Also, check the entries for m4DESTDIR and
m4SRCDIR, which point to where the help program will live on your
system, and where the sources for CARL programs will live on your
system.

Then edit Makefile.m4 in this directory and, if necessary, modify the
name of the program by changing the variable PROGNAME
if you already have a help program.  Then,
say mm to create a site-dependent Makefile, then say 

	% make 
then
	% make install

If you wish to modify the sources database for help, read ./SOURCES.
