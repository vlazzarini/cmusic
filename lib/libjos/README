COMMENTS:
Users normally access routines in joslib by including "-ljos" in the cc command.

Two executable files also live in this directory: one called "makejoslib"
which compiles all .c files in this directory and replaces them in the
library, and "addjoslib", which adds routine X to joslib when used as
"addjoslib X". (addjoslib assumes the file is actually called X.c).
