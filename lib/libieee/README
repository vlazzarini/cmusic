       In this release, libieee has been built with gfortran. You will need to 
       	 have this installed in your system. 

COMMENTS:

	the cc command. You will also need -lgfortran (libgfortran.*) to link to
        this code. 

SPECIAL NOTES:
	If you are installing this software on a machine that is not a vax
	you will need to check the file i1mach.f.

	a copy of the libieee.a archive library is provided.
