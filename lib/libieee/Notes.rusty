Had to give f77 -Nx argument; this tells it to use a larger table
for externals.

Added -w flag to f77.

Had to take out calls to "decode" in eqiir.f, this was documented
on how to do this. Saved original eqiir.f on eqiir.f.orig.

Modified mxfft.f to assume rounded arithmetic instead of trying to
compensate for truncation error; this is well documented in the code.

Modified pmpse.f to rename subroutine "fft" to "fftps"; this avoids
conflict with mxfft.f.
